# BALLOC
A Bad Allocator

## Why
To learn how allocators work

## How
C + GDB

## Allocation strategy
Free list is a BST with the address of the allocated blocks themselves being used as keys. Blocks have headers with left, right pointers to other Blocks, and a size_t size; allocated memory is sizeof(Block) + size.

## Is it any good?
Passable. Because the keys are the memory addresses, the BST leans heavily right, so performance degrades due to expensive search operations. Particularly, coalescing the successor is prohibitively expensive because the search operation for finding the successor is very expensive.
